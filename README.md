# Amazon Sales Data Visualization Project

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Amazon sales data using **Power BI** and **Python**. The dataset used for this project is sourced from **Kaggle**, and various insights into sales patterns, product performance, and customer behavior are extracted.

## Dataset

The dataset is available on Kaggle under the name "Amazon Sales Dataset" and contains detailed information such as:
- Product details
- Customer demographics
- Sales figures (unit price, quantity sold, etc.)
- Order details (order ID, shipping cost, etc.)
- Dates (order date, ship date, etc.)

### Data Source:
- [Kaggle - Amazon Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amazon-sales-data)

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning (Python)**: 
   - The initial dataset is cleaned using Python libraries such as **Pandas** and **NumPy** to handle missing values, data types, and duplicates.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is done using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to get a quick understanding of the data.

2. **Data Visualization (Power BI)**: 
   - The cleaned dataset is imported into Power BI.
   - Visual dashboards, KPIs, and interactive charts (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts) are created to visualize the key insights.
   - Slicers and filters are added to allow dynamic exploration of the data based on different regions, product categories, and time frames.

3. **Python Visualization**: 
   - Python is used to create detailed visualizations such as:
     - Heatmaps of sales trends by region
     - Time-series plots of monthly sales
     - Histograms of product category performance
     - Correlation analysis of sales-related variables

4. **Insights Gained**:
   - **Best-selling Products**: Identifying top-performing products by quantity and revenue.
   - **Regional Sales Trends**: Understanding which regions contribute most to sales.
   - **Customer Behavior**: Analyzing repeat purchase behavior, average spend per customer, etc.
   - **Time-Based Insights**: Analyzing sales trends over time, peak months, and seasons.
